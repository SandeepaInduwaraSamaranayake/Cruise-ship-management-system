# Cruise-ship-management-system
This repository consists of Java program for a Cruise Ship management System. This is a basic menu-driven command line program which I created as my Level 4 Sem 2 Software Development II coursework at University of Westminster. This program can manage activities like,<br>
<br> 1) Allocate cabins for passengers 
<br> 2) Delete passengers from cabins 
<br> 3) Keep records of passengers' expences
<br> 4) Update expences passengerwise
<br> 4) Find passengers by using either first name or last name
<br> 5) View all cabin status
<br> 6) Display empty cabins
<br> 7) Save all customer data into a text(.txt) file
<br> 8) Load all data back again into the program
<br> 9) Order all passenger names alphabetically
<br><br>
In this program exception handling is properly done to deal with any kind of unexpected exception. Basically this program contains three main versions.<br>
<br> 1) Cruise_Ship_Boarding_Program_Task_1 - This version is a basic version of the program with limited features.
<br> 1) Cruise_Ship_Boarding_Program_Task_2
<br> 1) Cruise_Ship_Boarding_Program_Task_3
